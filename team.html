<p>Prof.&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Kam-Ming Mark TAM is an Assistant Professor of Architectural Structures at the University of Hong Kong, specialising in computational design, structural geometry, and digital manufacturing techniques. He has expertise in Geometric Deep Learning (GDL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning, which he developed during his doctoral research at ETH Zürich. Tam’s doctoral thesis focused on novel GDL methodologies for learning and modelling hierarchical discrete data structures like meshes. Before his doctoral studies, Tam earned a Master of Engineering (MEng) from MIT and a Master of Architecture from the University of Waterloo. His MEng research, which proposed a method for robotics-enabled 3-D printing based on principal stress line, received the Tsuboi best paper award for the 2015th International Association for Shell and Spatial Structures. He has taught at various institutions, including Singapore University of Technology and Design and Pratt Institute. His work has been presented at numerous conferences, and he has contributed to the development of additive manufacturing techniques and the realisation of large-scale architectural projects such as OneC1TY in Nashville.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="co-chair-prof.-dr.-hongshan-guo">Co-Chair: Prof.&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Hongshan GUO</h3>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Hongshan Guo offers a unique blend of architectural aesthetics and robust engineering. Trained at Harbin Institute of Technology, and later at Columbia and Princeton Universities, she embodies the fusion of architectural finesse with engineering precision. Her expertise extends to predictive technologies, rooted in her background merging built environments with advanced computational models. Dr.&nbsp;Guo’s research focuses on radiant environments, thermal comfort, and enhancing human experiences within architectural spaces through advanced techniques. She explores the influence of radiant environments on perceived thermal comfort and advocates for integrating architectural designs with sustainable energy mechanisms such as photovoltaics and geothermal solutions. Beyond academia, her achievements include a patented technique in predictive analytics and a strategic role in a leading Fortune 500 financial company, leveraging Large Language Models for innovative applications. As she begins her journey at Hong Kong University, Dr.&nbsp;Guo promises to integrate traditional architectural principles with modern engineering solutions, offering transformative contributions to the institution’s architectural community.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="co-chair-dr.-garvin-goepel">Co-Chair: Dr.&nbsp;Garvin GOEPEL</h3>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Garvin Goepel is a designer and researcher specializing in integrating Augmented Reality (AR) with generative architecture. Currently a Post-doctoral Fellow and Lecturer at the University of Hong Kong (HKU), he completed his PhD at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) as a Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme awardee. Goepel’s research focuses on collaborative holographic-driven construction, technology-infused craftsmanship, and replacing conventional paper drawing-based communication with holographic instructions. He believes AR can democratize skill through simple, intuitive instructions without professional training. Goepel holds a Master of Architecture with distinction from the University of Applied Arts, Vienna, and has worked with practices such as Coop Himmelb(l)au. He has researched at ETH’s Block Research Group, CUHK, and HKU, published in leading conferences and journals, and taught AR and design workshops internationally. His work includes the mixed-reality artwork “Resonance-In-Sight” for the Hong Kong Museum of Arts. In 2021, he was part of the organizing committee for the 26th International Conference of CAADRIA.</p>

<h1>General Committee for CAADFutures</h1>
<section id="the-foundation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-foundation">The Foundation</h3>
<p>CAAD Futures was set up under Dutch law in 1985 with three founding members; Tom Maver, Rik Schijf, and Harry Wagter with the purpose of promoting, through international conferences and publications, the advancement of Computer Aided Architectural Design in the service of those concerned with the quality of the built environment with initial capital provided by the Housing Ministry of the Netherlands Government.</p>
<p>Many decades later, no longer based in the Netherlands, the Foundation continues to play a major global role in advancing the field and documenting progress in research with its biennial conference. We work in collaboration with the several regionally focused groups that have been established over these years to support and cultivate a richly diverse research community.</p>
<p>The mission of the CAAD Futures foundation continues to be:</p>
<p>to promote research interactions and collaborations between researchers, including PhD students and their supervisors;</p>
<p>to provide a platform for communication among researchers in the field of CAAD;</p>
<p>to play an active role in the dissemination of such progress to the scientific architectural community and the architectural practice.</p>
