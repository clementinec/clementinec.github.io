    "text": "Conference Theme\n\nCatalytic Interfaces\nThe theme for the CAAD Futures 2025 - Hong Kong Conference is “CATALYTIC INTERFACES”.\n“Catalytic Interfaces” focuses on the transformative role computation plays in the interfaces surrounding architectural design and production. Whether methodological, spatial, interdisciplinary, technological, ecological, communicational, or cultural—interfaces act as catalysts, introducing alternative mechanisms that facilitate more efficient, diverse, or radical processes, demonstrating a significant shift when compared to traditional methods.\nThe theme highlights how these interfaces grant access to extensive datasets and computational resources, enabling deeper levels of exploration, complexity, and interaction between designers and the built environment. This access fosters the rapid generation of architectural and urban designs by leveraging large data volumes.\nCAAD Futures 2025 aims to catalyse critical discussions on the implementation and impact of these catalytic interfaces within the architectural profession. The conference will address current and future challenges and opportunities for computation in architecture design and production, emphasising the potential for increased multidisciplinary collaboration and integration across various stakeholders."

    "text": "(Note: Precise dates to follow and are subject to change)\n\nPrelude\nInterested researchers are asked to form teams around a core expertise, and develop ideas for interdisciplinary research that interface with one or multiple CAAD topic areas, leading to the submission of an initial Statement of Interests by 30 September 2024. Statements are peer-reviewed by the Scientific Committee and promising statements and teams are then selected, with decisions announced by 21 October 2024.\n\n\nInitialisation of Catalysation\nThe committee shares the Statements among selected teams. Teams are asked identify list of possible team collaborators with relevant interests and/or expertise by 4 November 2024. Their indicated preference will be shared, enabling the teams to initiate discussions among themselves throughout November and December 2024 to identify joint collaborative research ideas.\n\n\nPre-Conference Catalysers\nTwo Catalyser online meeting events will be organised by the committee to finalise ideas and form team groups on 13 January 2025 and 3 March 2025. The catalyser will foster productive team pairs/groupings around emergent CAAD priorities synthesising the interests of teams. Teams are highly encouraged to formalise partnerships with at least one other team, indicating their initial choice by 27 January 2025.\n\n\nTowards Catalytic Interfaces\nTeam pairs/groups will prepare and submit Proposals that set the stage for their collaboration during the three-day conference to prototype their ideas. These proposals will undergo at least one-round of peer review by the scientific committee, and will be automatically considered for the Expert Invitation Award, which enable teams with outstanding proposals to sponsor the travel of team members or their invitees. Both feedback and decisions will be announced on 14 April 2025. Upon receiving the feedback and decisions, teams will refine their proposal, submitting their final proposals by 26 May 2025 to be included in the conference’s companion publication. Organisers arrange travel for invited experts during this period.\n\n\nConference: Catalytic Interfaces\nInspired by the concept of a Hackathon, groups of Catalysers will be encouraged to prototype and develop artefacts during the three-day conference. These artefacts may range from design concepts to texts, physical artefacts, or software products. Each artefact will embody the group’s position on the interfacing of topics discussed leading up to the conference. Dedicated time and space for Catalysers to collaborate will be provided throughout all three days, including stand-up meetings known as ‘Check In’ and ‘Check Out’ sessions that bookend each day’s paper sessions. These meetings are scheduled within the main programming and held in a common area to allow all conference participants to listen in and potentially join the discussions. Additionally, dedicated ‘Basecamps’ or classrooms will be reserved across the campus, providing spaces for more in-depth investigations.\nOn the final day of the conference, the groups of Catalysers will present their artefacts and refined positions in an event open to the public. This facilitates broader exchange and dissemination of ideas. The outcomes of the conference will be two-fold: a manifesto compiling the condensed positions of all Catalysers, and the opportunity for interested Catalysers to submit the outcomes of their three-day collaboration. These will be included in a companion publication by CAAD Futures and hosted on a dedicated open-access platform to complement the conference proceedings."

    "text": "Team Participation in ‘Catalytic Interfaces’\nWe invite researchers to take advantage of the special ‘Catalytic Interface’ programming. Interested researchers are asked to form teams around a core expertise, and develop ideas for interdisciplinary research that interface with one or multiple CAAD topic areas. Dedicated ‘Catalytic Interface’ programming and infrastructure both before and during the conference will offer a platform for selected teams to collaborate with like-minded teams with relevant expertise, catalysing initial discussions as well as the prototyping of ideas during the conference.\nSpecifically, the process begins with team formation and the submission of project proposals by 30 September 2024. Overall, the ‘Catalytic Interfaces’ process entails:\n\nProposal Submission: Each team, centred around a core expertise, will submit a proposal by 30 September 2024 (see below for instructions). Proposals are encouraged to outline collaboration ideas that explore new research interfaces across one or multiple CAAD topic areas beyond the team’s existing expertise.\nTeam Selection: A peer review process will select promising proposals.\nTeam Dialogue: Selected teams will review each other’s work, initiating dialogue based on shared interests. A series of online catalyser events in early 2025 will foster productive team pairings around emergent CAAD research priorities.\nPosition Paper Submission: Team pairs/groupings will then submit a Position Paper, which will undergo a peer review process.\nPublication of Position Papers: Position Papers will be published through the conference’s companion publication ahead of the conference.\nConference Prototyping and Presentation: During the three-day conference, team pairs will prototype their ideas, culminating in public presentations at the end of the event.\nExpert Invitation Awards: From the final selection of projects, CAAD Futures 2025 will offer up to eight Expert Invitation Awards to support travel expenses for an expert team member or their expert invitee, aiming to enhance impactful collaboration and outcomes. Awardees will have the opportunity to chair a panel session or speaker-driven paper session.\n\nProposal submissions shall include the following items:\n\nA succinct and descriptive title;\nList of team members with a 100-word biography for each member;\nThe CAAD area(s) related to the team’s core expertise and interests; and\nIdentified CAAD areas where the team seeks collaboration via ‘Catalytic Interfaces’;\nA Statement of Interest of no longer than 1000 words (excluding references) that clearly describes a research question or thesis that the team wishes to develop through ‘Catalytic Interfaces’, synthesising CAAD areas in point c and d, and outlining the potential benefits and anticipated impact of this synthesis on architecture.\nUp to 5 nominees for the Expert Invitation Award (in order of preference), which may include either team members or external invitees.\n\nOur submission system is now open. Please submit your ‘Catalytic Interfaces’ proposal via EasyChair here by 30 September 2024.

Interested researchers are asked to form teams around a core expertise, and develop ideas for interdisciplinary research that interface with one or multiple CAAD topic areas. Dedicated ‘Catalytic Interface’ programming and infrastructure both before and during the conference will offer a platform for selected teams to collaborate with like-minded teams with relevant expertise, catalysing initial discussions as well as the prototyping of ideas during the conference.\nSpecifically, the process begins with team formation and submission of Initial Statement of Interest by 16 September 2024.\nWe are still actively working to set up the submission system. Please revisit in early September for updates, and we appreciate your enthusiasm and patience in the meantime.\nStatements are peer-reviewed and promising statements and teams are then selected. Next, a series of online catalyser events are held to foster productive team pairs/groupings around emergent CAAD priorities synthesising their interests. Team pairs/groupings will then submit Proposals that set the stage for their collaboration during the three-day conference to prototype their ideas. Ultimately, these efforts will culminate in the publication of peer-reviewed proposals through the conference’s companion publication, as well as public presentations at the end of the conference. See A1 for additional details on the special programming and A3 for a tentative timeline of both programme and the submission process.\nSubmissions shall include the following items:\n\nA succinct and descriptive title;\n\nList of team members with a 100-word biography for each member;\nThe CAAD area(s) related to the team’s core expertise and interests; and\n\nIdentified CAAD areas where the team seeks collaboration via ‘Catalytic Interfaces’;\nA Statement of Interest of no longer than 1000 words that clearly describes a research question or thesis that the team wishes to develop through ‘Catalytic Interfaces’, synthesising CAAD areas in c and d, and outlining the potential benefits and anticipated impact of this synthesis on architecture.\n\nA tentative Expert Invitation Award will also be offered to outstanding proposals to sponsor the travel of team members or their invitees, aiming to enhance the potential for impactful collaboration and output.\n\nRegular Paper Submission\n\nWe invite researchers to submit abstracts by 16 September 2024.\nWe are still actively working to set up the submission system. Please revisit in early September for updates, and we appreciate your enthusiasm and patience in the meantime.\nAbstracts should be of no longer than 250 words.
